VodaSMS

This program was written to avoid the horrors of the Vodacom4me website
(http://www.vodacom4me.co.za). It allows you to do all sorts of things with
your sms account without having to leave the comfort of your command line.

Getting Started
---------------

* Extract the vodasms tarball, I assume you have already done that if you are
  reading this. I like to put everything into ~/.vodasms/ .

* Edit the configuration file, vodasms.ini, to include the relevant
  information. The configuration file needs to be in the ~/.vodasms/ directory.
  If you would like to change that edit the configfile variable at the top of
  the 'vodasms' script.

* Ensure that the perl modules WWW::Mechanize and Config:IniFiles are
  installed. If you are not root then put them somewhere, uncomment and
  update the BEGIN line at the top of the vodasms script.

* Look at the example phonebook provided and create a phonebook. This is not
  mandatory as normal phone numbers can be used.

* Send an sms.

Usage
-----

vodasms [number|name from phonebook] <message>

e.g.
vodasms +27821234567 hello
vodasms Dominic "hello"

Testing
-------

My number is in the default phonebook, and I like getting sms'es. So send me an
sms telling me what you think.

vodasms Dominic "OMFG I have never seen such awful Perl, and that's saying a lot\!"
